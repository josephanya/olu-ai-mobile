# Olu AI App

Olu AI is an open-source, offline-first mobile application that allows Community Health Workers (CHWs) to record and analyze patient encounters using AI. By leveraging speech-to-text and large language models, Olu AI helps CHWs document visits, generate differential diagnoses, and create management plans - all without requiring internet connectivity.
